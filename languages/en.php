  <p>Currently, I am a mechatronics student, I chose this field of study due to the extensive material that is taught. I've always loved learning new things, so I started programming at a young age. My first
  games and the process by which they were created were of interest. Looking for a language that would be the most convenient for me, I was doing projects in Unreal Engine, Unity, Gamemaker, Godot and RPG Maker. Everything changed when I was in high school
  I took a course in HTML and CSS. As I learned about the web development process, I found it to be the medium between art and programming that I had been looking for for so long. Since then, I have done websites for local businesses too
  free. Unfortunately, one of them no longer exists and the other forgot about the website's existence. I aspire to become a fullstack developer, I am learning and developing all the time. Of course, not only in the field of programming, but also in art. I was doing
  graphic designs for nationwide events (eg RoboMotion), local companies in Tarnobrzeg and Sandomierz, for companies (eg Laveco, Xcite), or even for teams of players (eg Trident Team Arma 3). Nothing brings me so much
  joy like the fact that someone can show off something that I created for him. </p>",
